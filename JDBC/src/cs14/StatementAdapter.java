	 * indicates that the command failed to execute successfully and occurs only if a driver continues
	 * to process commands after a command fails
	 *
	 * The possible implementations and return values have been modified in the Java 2 SDK, Standard
	 * Edition, version 1.3 to accommodate the option of continuing to process commands in a batch
	 * update after a BatchUpdateException object has been thrown.

	 * elements of the array are ordered according to the order in which commands were added to the
